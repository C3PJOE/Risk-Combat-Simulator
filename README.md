# Risk-Combat-Simulator
Included in this repo is: 

1) the arduino program file 
2) the auto generated schematic (from tinkercad)
3) the auto generated componentst list (from tinkercad)

The program uses 3 red LEDs and 2 green LEDs to represent the attackers and defenders from the popular board game Risk.
There are three push buttons on the breadboard; one is used to set the number of attackers, one is used to set the number of defenders, 
and the third one is used to initialize the "dice" roll. The LEDs will turn on initially to reflect the selected units, then begin to blink, 
then the "surviving" LEDs will become solid, while the "destroyed" LEDs turn off.
